## Features

- **3D Object Generation**: Generate realistic 3D objects from images or specifications.
- **3D Scene Reconstruction**: Reconstruct complex scenes from simple inputs.
- **Image-to-3D Transformation**: Convert 2D images into 3D models seamlessly.
- **High Performance**: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for fast processing.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed for compatibility with existing 3D software and libraries.

## Installation

To get started with PartCrafter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hothanhdat2002/PartCrafter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PartCrafter
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have the necessary software for 3D rendering. You may need tools like Blender or Unity, depending on your project requirements.

## Usage

After installation, you can use PartCrafter in your projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

1. Import the library:
   ```python
   from partcrafter import MeshGenerator
   ```

2. Initialize the generator:
   ```python
   generator = MeshGenerator()
   ```

3. Generate a 3D object:
   ```python
   object_3d = generator.create_mesh_from_image('path/to/image.jpg')
   ```

4. Save or render the 3D object:
   ```python
   object_3d.save('output/path/3d_object.obj')
   ```

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can achieve with PartCrafter:

### Example 1: Basic Object Generation

Using a simple image, you can create a 3D object that resembles the input. This is useful for creating assets for games or simulations.

### Example 2: Scene Reconstruction

PartCrafter can take multiple images of a scene and reconstruct a 3D model. This feature is particularly useful in architectural visualization.

### Example 3: Customization

You can customize the output by tweaking parameters in the `MeshGenerator`. Experiment with different settings to achieve the desired results.
